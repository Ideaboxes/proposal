After playing with a few routers and got some limitations, now I want a new one myself from the hardware that can
buy from a market which might be more powerful and cheaper.

- Have a nice web user interface on both desktop and mobile.
- Reliable wifi with atleast 50 devices.
- Transfer speed as higher as posible.
- Can attach to storage and have file sharing service that can configure in web ui.
