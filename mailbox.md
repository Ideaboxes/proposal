# Mailbox

This idea came out with @keang when waiting for friends coming to watch a movie but they came late but we can't 
leave a ticket to someone else so we think it would be nice if in front of cinema have a mailbox that can put a 
movie ticket inside and set a password and send to friend and we go inside first. So we don't miss the beginning
of the movie.

## Problems

- If you use man collecting and giving things, people won't trust to leave things to this guy because they can move.
- If it's a box that can't move, have to rent a place but people have more trust with the thing that don't move.
- The box that has a mechanic inside to keep thing with password and unlock when people come with correct password.
