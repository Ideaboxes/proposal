# Shout room

The room is sound proof so anything that you shout out won't go out from the room. It won't have anything for record
sound and in the center of the room has an VR glass that when you put it on your head you will see yourself standing
on the cliff. It might has an option to change the view to any place but the purpose is simulate loneliness place
that you can shout without any person listening and don't need to climb the moutain to do this thing.
