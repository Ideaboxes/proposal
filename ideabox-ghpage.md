# Ideabox Github page.

Just an idea for playing with github, instead of create an issue directly by click `+` in proposal project. 
Have a github page provide with format for create an proposol might be better with a collection of discussion
automatically pull from an issue.

## JS Library for github

I'm not sure about security yet but seems it will be very weak to make it usable. 

- https://github.com/michael/github
- https://github.com/k33g/gh3

## Plan features

- Create/Edit proposol page, this might create an iframe to wrap around github if library is not possible. Have to think about it more
- Listing all proposal
- Discussion under each proposal, can be an issue or using discus service.
